# Appointment Planner #  
  
## Overview ##  
Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project youâ€™ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.
  
## Project Goals ##
In this project, you will use functional React components to create an app that manages contacts and appointments. The app consists of two pages: one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments.

The requirements section will walk through implementing the app from the topmost component down. If you would like to implement it in a different order feel free to do what is comfortable for you.  
  
## Project Requirements ##  

Implement App as a stateful component that maintains appointments and contacts. It should also pass those values, along with callback functions to update those state values, to its child components.  
  
### App Requirements: - App.js ###
  
- Keep track of the contacts and appointments data, each being an array of objects
- Define a callback function that, given a name, phone number, and email, adds a new contact object with that data to the array of contacts
- Define a callback function that, given a title, contact, date, and time, adds a new appointment object with that data to the array of appointments
- Pass the array of contacts and the appropriate callback function as props to the ContactsPage component
- Pass the appointments array, contacts array, and the add appointment function as props to the AppointmentsPage component
